<title>Eiffel: The Reference -  Preface</title>
<h1> Preface</h1>
<p>
This document serves two purposes:<p>
<ul>
<li>It is submitted to the Language Committee of the 
<I>Nonprofit International 
</I>Consortium for Eiffel 
as the second step towards a standard definition of Eiffel (the 
first step was the book 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>).
<li>It provides users of Eiffel with a short language definition.</ul><p>
For the first of these goals, note that the present Preface is not part of the intended 
Standard. 
<p>
<h2>WHAT IS EIFFEL?</h2>
<p>
The name Eiffel covers a method and a language for the systematic development of 
quality software, based on the full application of object-oriented principles. 
<p>
<p>
Only the language aspect is covered in this book. Other documents are available on 
the method and on the various compilers, tools and environments that make it possible to 
develop software with Eiffel. 
<p>
<p>
A complete description of the Eiffel language has been previously published: the 
book 
<I>Eiffel: The Language 
</I>(Prentice Hall, second printing with corrections, 1992, ISBN 
0-13-24795-7). The intent of that document is to provide under a single cover a precise 
reference, a tutorial, a Guide for the Perplexed, and a detailed user's manual for the 
language. As a result, much of the space in it is occupied by examples, explanations, 
justifications, discussions, previews, reminders and comments. ''Eiffel: The Language'' 
does not shun repetition; occasionally, for example, some part of the  discussion needs to 
refer to the syntax of a construct seen in a distant chapter, and simply reproduces the 
syntax specification for the convenience of the reader. 
<p>
<p>
In some cases, however, a shorter reference may be necessary. A typical example is 
that of someone implementing an Eiffel compiler, who may be presumed to be familiar 
with the rationale behind the various components of the language, but will need a 
document where he can quickly find precise answers to specific questions, often on fine 
points (''Can the target of an anchored declaration be anchored too?''). Another example 
is that of a user who is familiar with the language but wants to keep a concise reference 
on his desk. 
<p>
<p>
Providing such a no-frills description of Eiffel is the purpose of 
<I>Eiffel: The 
</I>Reference.<p>
<h2>THE SHORT FORM</h2>
<p>
The worst that could happen to the description of Eiffel is to follow the fate of so many 
earlier languages: the emergence of several descriptions, each slightly incompatible with 
the others. 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I> went to considerable length to prevent this from 
happening. By threading several levels of discourse into a single cloth, the book was able 
to forestall eventual divergence. 
<p>
<p>
In particular, the book relied on an extensive system of ''road signs'' to identify each 
of the interwoven threads: syntax, validity, semantics, comment, caveat, preview, reminder. 
<p>
<p>
As this system is directly reflected in the source electronic form of the original 
document, it is possible to use software tools, aided by a little human intervention, to 
extract one or several of the threads. This approach is what made the present book 
possible. It is not, strictly speaking, a new book, but an 
<B>extract</B> of the relevant parts of 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>. 
<p>
<p>
Another way of expressing this observation is to claim that producing this book was, 
to a certain extent, a software project: writing the tools that would extract the essential parts 
of the complete document and ignore the rest. This effort required some ''massaging'', as 
programmers say, of the original text, to mark some parts as retained and others as 
discarded. But the extent of that massaging was remarkably limited: the text was organized 
in such a systematic way that most of the extraction could be done automatically, based on 
a number of selection rules not unlike those of a little expert systems. 
<p>
<p>
Anyone familiar with the Eiffel method will have recognized the idea: it is the 
notion of short form. To document an Eiffel class, you do not as a rule write a separate 
document; you should instead include the relevant information in the class text itself, and 
rely on computer tools to extract views of the class at various levels of abstraction, in 
particular the short (or flat-short) form which only keeps the interface properties of the 
class 
 signatures, preconditions, postconditions and header comments of exported 
features, class invariant 
 while discarding the implementation information (non-exported features, routine bodies, distinction between functions and attributes). Here we 
are doing the same with respect to the language itself: using the power of the computer 
to remove the non-essential information from a complete description. 
<p>
<p>
The major advantage, in the case of classes, is that we can keep a single description. 
So when things evolve 
 as they inevitably will, be they classes or languages 
 we have 
only one document to maintain. This may be called the 
<B>principle of single reference</B> and 
is essential to the smooth evolution of the language and its description.<p>
<p>
Although the work of the NICE library committee may cause changes to be brought 
to the present document independently of 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>, every effort will be made 
to maintain the principle of single reference, avoiding the disaster that divergence 
between the two documents would mean for Eiffel. In particular, the structure and section 
numbering will be kept the same for the two books, and changes made to the present one 
as a result of the committee's work will be continuously reflected back into the electronic 
version of 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>.<p>
<h2>LIBRARY ELEMENTS</h2>
<p>
The definition of Eiffel relies on a number of predefined classes in the "Kernel Library", 
covering such fundamental notions as basic types (<I>BOOLEAN</I>, 
<I>INTEGER 
</I>and the like), 
arrays, input and output.<p>
<p>
A standard document for the Kernel Library, known as the ELS
(<I>The Eiffel Library Standard</I>) has been adopted by NICE. To avoid 
any ambiguity or contradiction, all discussions of Kernel Library classes in this book 
have been replaced by references to the ELS. The version of ELS referred to by
this document is 'Vintage 95'.<p>
<h2>CHANGES</h2>
<p>
This book correspnds to the second printing of 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>. It incorporates a 
few corrections corresponding to mistakes that have been detected since the publication 
of the book. The principal among these changes are listed in chapter 14 of 
<I>ISE Eiffel: The 
</I>Environment 
(Technical Report TR-39/IE).<I></I><p>
<p>
A complete list of the changes will be made available separately. Time prevented 
inclusion of change bars for the first release of this document, but they will be part of 
future editions; all changes have been carefully logged. 
<p>
<p>
In case of discrepancy between 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I> and 
<I>Eiffel: The Reference</I>, 
follow the document that has the latest printing date, unless the problem appears to be due 
to a text processing mistake. Remember that at the basis of Eiffel there is only one 
document; the only differences result from how one selects and prints portions of that 
document. This is the required condition for the stability, maturity and credibility of the 
Eiffel language; in other words, for its success. 
<p>
<p>
The present book uses the same conventions as 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>. To avoid any 
confusion, the original chapter and section numbers have been retained. So if you have 
leafed through this book before reading the present preface, you may have wondered why 
the first chapter is number 2 and its first section 2.2; but the purpose is clear: making it 
easy to find the corresponding place in 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I> if when examining some part 
of the edifice you want to retrieve the scaffolding 
 in other words some of the 
supporting comments and examples. Using a different section numbering scheme for the 
present book would have caused endless misunderstandings. 
<p>
<p>
Unlike the sections, the pages have been renumbered, since consecutive numbering 
facilitates searching for specific information. 
<p>
<p>
In contrast with 
<I>Eiffel: The Language</I>, this book avoids repetition of any kind. This 
is why you will find no syntax summary or syntax diagram. Such elements (which are 
present in the complete description) will be easy to add if readers feel they are necessary. 
<p>
<p>
There is currently no index, but this omission will be repaired in a future version.<p>
<p>
<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p>
In addition to the acknowledgments included at the end of  the preface to 
<I>Eiffel: The 
</I>Language, it is appropriate to thank the various readers who have contributed comments 
since the book's publication, most remarkably David Hollenberg from the Information 
Systems Institute of the University of Southern California and Helmut Weber from 
Austria, formerly from IBM. 

<h4>Note by consolidator</h4>
It is now time to enshrine in print the marvellous contribution to the
furtherance of software engineering made by Bertrand Meyer in creating
Eiffel and its techniques. Although he is quick to pass credit to the
many who have contributed to Eiffel's development over the years,
without his role as chief architect Eiffel would be much less than it is
today. More than likely it would not exist.  I would like to say 'thank
you' on behalf of Eiffel users everywhere.
