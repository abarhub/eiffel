Bertrand Meyer. (As you will see in the text, the copyright for the language 
reference and ELKS parts is meant to be released for free use once the book is 
in final form.) These pages are meant for consultation by colleagues and 
friends, especially members of the ECMA Eiffel standardization committee. To 
avoid lots of potential trouble, in particular with the publisher:

  original troff text of the first edition. It usually has many inconsistencies, 
  errors, missing elements and bizarre properties (even if some extracts appear

border=0>&nbsp;Latest news and changes: year 2002</H2>
<P><I>21 Sept 2002</I>: <B>Version 4.82-00-00</B> Following an informal meeting 
on 16 September and a suggestion by Éric Bezault, added rule that if there is an 
inheritance part at least one of the Parent clauses must specify conforming 
(non-expanded) inheritance. This ensures the property that every type conforms 
to ANY, which otherwise would disappear as a result of the introduction of 
non-conforming inheritance. That property is now stated as a rule, the Universal 
Conformance rule, which is not a new validity constraint but a theorem ensured 
by the other conformance rules. The affected sections are 6.6 and 6.9, both in 
the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/inheritance.pdf">inheritance 
chapter</A>. 
<P>I might rename "non-conforming inheritance" as "expanded inheritance" since 
this is what people tend to use. 
<P>I started some time ago updating the text to take into account the changes 
decided at the Santa Barbara meeting in August (contracts on attributes etc.). 
It's actually rather delicate since it affects many parts of the text and puts 
into question the very structure of the exposition, so it's going to take 
considerablee time. 
<P><I>11 June 2002</I>: <B>Version 4.80-00-11</B> (Updated here 10 August 2002, 
sorry for the delay). Although not reflected on this page, there has been much 
activity recently with the start of the ECMA standards group for Eiffel (ECMA 
TC39-TG4). Contact <A href="http://www.ecma.ch/">ECMA</A> about participation. 
The version updated here corresponds to the initial text discussed in the June 
TG4 meeting.

changes (hence the top-level version increment): 
<UL>
  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  Added considerable generality to the once mechanism, allowing once keys. This 
  is in the <A 
  href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/routine.pdf">routine 
  chapter</A> and, mostly, in a section of the <A 
  href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/call.pdf">call semantics 
  chapter</A> (that's the only part of the chapter worked on so far). This has 
  also meant changing the syntax of Debug since there is now no more notion of 
  Debug_key and Debug_key_list, simply Key_list used for both Once and Debug. 
  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  Removed the assignment attribute mechanism altogether. This turned out to be 
  too messy for its sake. </P></UL>
<P>Other changes: chapter on <A

structures</A> (see also the <A

strings and on types. Forward references to the planned change in exception 
mechanism, to be added soon. Cleanup and style improvements on the whole 
chapter. There will be another update today or tomorrow as I have since then 
updated the tutorial and "Eiffel in a Nutshell". 
<P>Lengthened the version number convention to give myself more opportunities of

introducing <B>infix</B> "}={" as a synonym to <I>equal</I>. As usual, many 
improvements (I hope they are improvements) to the explanations and the 
examples. I didn't touch the semantics of deep equality, although Michael

will ask him if he remembers what the problem was.

<P><I>26 December 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.77-1</B>: I am working on the Lace

<P><I>19 December 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.76-0</B>: Addition of a mechanism to 
remove class names conflicts through qualification by cluster names. The chapter 
principally affected is the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/structure.pdf">architecture 
chapter</A>. Here is the message to the Talkitover group explaining this change: 

<UL>
  <UL>
    <P>This version adds a simple mechanism for removing name clashes between 
    classes. ISE Eiffel (I don't know about others) had previously used, since 
    4.0 or so, a Lace renaming mechanism, but this has proved to be 
    unsatisfactory. The policy that has been adopted now results from careful 
    evaluation of those in other languages, in particular namespaces as present 
    in recent versions of C++ and Smalltalk, as well as the .NET model and C# 
    (requiring, in the latter case, the use of a keyword `using' similar to 
    Ada's `with'). We found that this was overkill and adopted a much simpler 
    solution. Within a cluster, no two classes may have the same name. A 
    conflict arises if and only if you try to use a class name <I><FONT 
    color=blue>C</FONT></I> such that no class of that name exists in the 
    current cluster (if one does, it will be the one selected), but two or more 
    classes are called <I><FONT color=blue>C</FONT></I> in other clusters. Then, 
    to refer to that class, you must qualify it by its cluster name: <I><FONT 
    color=blue>cluster1</FONT></I>::<I><FONT color=blue>C</FONT></I> or <I><FONT 
    color=blue>cluster2</FONT></I>::<I><FONT color=blue>C</FONT></I>. Even when 
    not required through this rule, such a fully qualified name is now a valid 
    form of Class_name, valid anywhere we need a class name (e.g. in a type 
    name, or in a selective exports clause), with the exception of a class 
    definition itself, 
    <P>
    <UL>
      <P><B><FONT color=navy>class</FONT></B> <I><FONT color=blue>C</FONT></I> 
      </P></UL>
    <P>where <I><FONT color=blue>C</FONT></I> must be unqualified. 
    <P>The cluster name comes from the outside, typically an Ace file or 
    equivalent. It is thus local to every system, although a library may come 
    with a mini-Ace, to be included as is, and specifying a cluster name, so 
    that systems using the library don't have to define their own cluster names 
    from the library. 
    <P>We haven't implemented this mechanism but feel that it's the right way to 
    go -- simple, not overkill, and safe. I am not too keen on the :: symbol, 
    but don't have a better suggestion now. (I'd originally used a single :, but 
    a declaration of the form <I><FONT color=blue>x</FONT></I>: <I><FONT 
    color=blue>cluster_name</FONT></I>:<I><FONT color=blue>CLASS_NAME</FONT></I> 
    seems a bit strange.) </P></UL></UL>
<P>The changes are mostly in the last section of the Architecture chapter 
(currently chapter 3). 
<P><I>19 December 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.75-3</B>: Typographical improvements 
and more corrections on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">agent chapter</A>. 
following comments by Marcel Satchell and Sam O'Connor (on the EiffelVision 
example). (There was a 4.75-2 earlier today.) 
<P><I>14 December 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.75-1</B>: A few corrections on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">agent chapter</A> 
following comments by Marcel Satchell. 
<P><I>13 December 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.75-0</B>: New version of the Agent 
mechanism and the corresponding <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">agent chapter</A>. 
<P>I have integrated a new syntax and various simplifications for agents. Other 
than errors (which probably remain, since I haven't reviewed the text 
extensively) I hope this is a final version of the mechanism. It uses a keyword 
syntax and has a simple, general notation for inline agents. 
<P>(Note: I find no record here of version 4.74-0, so I must have forgotten to 
update the Web page back in September. It was the first step towards this update 
of the agent mechanism.) 
<P><I>25 August 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.73-1</B>: Fixed a few typos in the just 
revised section on Verbatim_string in the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/expression.pdf">expression 
chapter</A>. 
<P>Updated the appendix on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/reserved.pdf">reserved words and 
special symbols</A> to reflect recent changes, in particular by adding the 
keyword <B><FONT color=#0000a0>agent</FONT></B>. 
<P><I>25 August 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.73-0</B>: <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">Agent chapter</A>: 
the agent mechanism has been resyntaxed and slightly revaliditied and 
resemantiqued. Full chapter up to date. Keyword-based syntax (no more tilde ~ 
and vertical bar |); complete unification between feature-based agents and 
inline agents; full power of anonymous routines. The possibilities are quite 
interesting. Before starting PDF regeneration I forgot to update the keyword and 
operator lists at the end of the book (~ and | are out, `agent' is in) but have 
done it on my working copy, so the PDF version will be OK the next time around. 
<P>Also: in the discussion of Verbatim_string in the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/expression.pdf">expression 
chapter</A>, refined the notion further (see <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/#verbatim_jul2000">earlier 
change</A>) to allow for left-justified verbatim strings. As before the 
expression chapter is still not ready, but some parts are, including the 
relevant one for this change: the section on manifest strings, currently 26.18. 
<P><I>13 August 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.72-0</B>: <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">Agent chapter</A>: 
New syntax proposal. Chapter is not complete (stopped on page 677, mark should 
be clear) but there is enough for discussion. Unifies routine agents with inline 
agents. <A name=verbatim_jul2000>
<P><I>21 July 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.71-0</B>: <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/expression.pdf">Expression 
chapter</A>: Refined the notion of Verbatim_string to allow for a way of 
escaping the end-of-string marker. This takes care of a very extreme and rare 
case, and for that case adds 1.5 pages of text, two syntax constructs, and a 
validity constraint, so it's not attractive, but someone finally convinced me 
that any marker has to have an escape convention. 
<P>Note that the expression chapter is still not ready, but some parts are, 
including the relevant one for this change: the section on manifest strings, 
currently 26.18. </A>
<P><I>4 May 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.70-0</B>: Chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/repeated.pdf">Repeated 
inheritance</A> now ready. I have incremented the third-level version number 
since this introduces a major language change, discussed in the past couple of 
months: simplifying the semantics of repeated inheritance by removing the Select 
clause and relying instead on non-conforming inheritance. Although I didn't 
expect to do any more chapter-moving at this stage, I have shifted the repeated 
inheritance chapter to after the chapters on type and conformance because the 
rules rely extensively on conformance. It's actually better that way since types 
and generics are more basic concepts than repeated inheritance. 
<P>As a consequence I have also had to make fairly extensive changes to <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/redeclaration.pdf">Feature 
adaptation</A> chapter released two weeks ago. To make them easier to spot I am 
also releasing a <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/redec-changes.pdf">change bar 
version of the Feature Adaptation chapter</A> (which will be removed in a couple 
of weeks). The most significant changes start on page 328. 
<P>A minor addition has also been brought to the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/conform.pdf">conformance/convertibility</A> 
chapter (definition of "conformance path"). Several other chapters have been 
touched as well. 
<P>As usual, the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/changes.pdf">changes 
appendix</A> has been brought up to date. 
<P><I>4 May 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.64-0</B>: Chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/redeclaration.pdf">Feature 
adaptation</A> now ready. I have incremented the second-level version number 
since this is the first time ETL officially integrates the Precursor mechanism, 
even though it has of course been available in practice for quite some time. 
Other than Precursor, the only significant language change is the removal of the 
prohibition on redefining an External routine into an Internal one, or 
conversely. This used to have a justification with early conventions on external 
routines, but became no more than an implementation restriction with no 
conceptual justification. 
<P><I>21 February 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.63-1</B>: Revised chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">interfaces to 
external languages</A> to support new, clearer, more regular syntax (see 
4.63-0). Considerably simplified syntax for C, C++ and DLL sublanguages. Better 
conventions; there is hardly any need for a % any more. No more brackets in 
sublanguage specifications. This was essentially the work of Emmanuel Stapf. 
(The trend was started Pierre Métras some time ago.) 
<P><I>21 February 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.63-0</B>: Revised chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">interfaces to 
external languages</A> to support new, clearer syntax. See 4.63-1. 
<P><I>17 February 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.62-0</B>: non-conforming inheritance 
<P>Perhaps incautiously, I have gone ahead and introduced the notion of 
non-polymorphic inheritance in all the previously written chapters. (The main 
affected ones are <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/inheritance.pdf">features</A> 
and <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/conform.pdf">conformance/convertibility</A>. 

<P>The bad news is that I feel pretty happy with myself; the impact on the 
presentation has been remarkably simple. None of the conformance or 
convertibility rules need to be changed! All I have had to do is include a new 
optional component in the syntax, and a number of explanations and extra 
examples. This is bad news because when I feel that happy it's usually a sign 
that I should have waited the proverbial night and that there is probably 
something rotten in the kingdom, which one of the distinguished members of this 
group will undoubtedly discover right away. Well, I am foolish enough to publish 
the material as is tonight. We'll see (after the usual 90 minutes or so, only 
about 75 when this message reaches you). 
<P>Note that the simplicity of the change comes in part from the use of the 
keyword <B><FONT color=#0000a0>expanded</FONT></B> for what Jim Nelson called 
flat inheritance. Although the purpose of a language design is not primarily to 
make the scribe's task easier, I -- being the self-appointed scribe -- am 
finding the appeal of self-convenience hard to resist in this case. 
<P>Before I move to anything else I have to revisit the conformance rules on 
tuples, which I don't think are right although I don't yet know the proper fix. 
<P><I>February 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.61-0</B>: (A minor release, 4.60-5, a few 
days ago, was not documented.) This new version on or before 23:41 tonight PDT, 
i.e. 08:41 Paris meridian time) includes two language changes:

  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  Following a comment by Marcel Satchell I have updated the validity constraint 
  for convertibility (CNCP, section 15.13, subsection "Conversion rules", 
  currently page 449) to account for a case that I had missed regarding generic 
  types. This was a serious mistake and I am grateful he found it. 
  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  - In the agent chapter I have added a notion of inline procedure agent 
  parenthesized by `do'...`end'. Previously inline agents described functions. 
  This change arose of discussions with participants in the "Advanced Software 
  Development Using Eiffel" taught last week, particularly Michael Gacsaly. I 
  found I couldn't really justify the lack of consistency in the handling of 
  procedures/functions (instructions/expressions). The addition doesn't 
  complicate things too much. I even managed to keep the chapter's page count 
  unchanged at the price of some cheating. See sections 25.17 and 25.18 in the 
  agent chapter. </P></UL>
<P>Other changes: I fixed a number of typos (thanks to Marcel, Ian Joyner, 
Pierre Metras, Joachim Durchholz and others) and removed references to the 
"Balancing rule" (some may remain. 
<P><I>1 February 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.60-4</B>: A fairly major new release, 
integrating the recently discussed conversion mechanism. (There have already 
been 4.60-0 to 4.60-3 in the past couple of weeks.) Several chapters updated, in 
particular <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/feature.pdf">features</A> (see 
section on target conversion) and <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/conform.pdf">conformance</A>, 
the latter renamed "conformance and convertibility" and now almost 50% longer 
than before, which is of course subject to criticism. Chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/reattach.pdf">reattachment and 
equality</A> is complete. Also, corrections on a number of other chapters, 
thanks to comments by Ian Joyner. 
<P><I>January 9, 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.51-3</B>: Chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/entity.pdf">objects, values and 
entities</A> now ready. I have also used the opportunity to simplify and improve 
the <A href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type 
chapter</A> and fill in some forgotten elements in the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/changes.pdf">changes 
appendix</A>. No new language changes. 
<P><I>January 6, 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.51-2</B>: <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/attribute.pdf">attribute 
chapter</A> now ready. 
<P>There is no language change in this release, except that I have included (in 
the semantics rule) the change indicated previously (see the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/#v4_51_0">entry on 4.51-0 just 
below</A>) that guarantees uniqueness of Unique values even across classes. This 
change raises potential implementation problems so it might be rescinded later 
on. 
<P>Otherwise this is just a cleanup of the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/attribute.pdf">attribute 
chapter</A>. 
<P><I>January 3, 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.51-1</B>: Corrections on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type chapter</A> 
(typos and inconsistencies) thanks again to Marcel Satchell. <A 
name=v4_51_0></A>
<P><I>January 2, 2000</I>: <B>Version 4.51-0</B>: <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/control.pdf">Control Structures 
chapter</A> now ready. Only one language change: the last clause of COMB, the 
constraint on Multi_branch instructions (clause 6 in ETL 1/2) has been removed. 
It required all Unique constants of a given Multi_branch to come from the same 
class. It is now felt that this is unfairly passing an implementation issue on 
to programmers. If there is too much complaining from implementers, however, the 
clause will be reinstated. 
<P>This version also includes numerous corrections on earlier chapters, courtesy 
Marcel Satchell's careful reading. 
<P><I>January 2, 2000</I>: <B>Version renumbering for consistency.</B> The last 
few versions should have been called 4.50-x. They now are. The record (below and 
in the Talkitover archive) has been corrected. Sorry for any confusion. <A

border=0>&nbsp;Changes in year 1999</H2>
<P><I>December 30, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.50-3.</B> This version corrects a 
number of errors in the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">agent chapter</A> as 
a result of comments by Marcel Satchell (many thanks). Some of these had 
consequences on the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/elks.pdf">ELKS chapter</A>. 
<P>I have sneakily added two words at the bottom of page 630 which permit ~a 
where `a' is an attribute, the agent being of type FUNCTION (there was a 
reference to a class ATTRIBUTE but I have removed it -- too complicated). This 
possibility may be removed later, however, if it is found that the 
implementation hardship is not worth the extra benefit. (This would contradict 
the Uniform Access principle, but only for one specific language construct.) 
<P><I>December 29, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.50-2.</B> (There was an intermediate, 
undocumented 4.50-1 a few days ago.) This is a fairly major release. Here is 
some of what's in it:

  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  <A href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">Agent 
  chapter</A>: many small changes and improvements. Added creation agent example

  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif"> 
  <A href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">Agent

  that BOOLEAN-returning FUNCTION agents are instances of this class. Very 
  important for work on trusted components (neither space nor time to explain 
  here, but believe me). 
  <P><IMG alt=+ src="Eiffel The Language, third edition_fichiers/greenball.gif">

  completed specification of ROUTINE, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION and PREDICATE. I hope 
  it's close to final. Very close to current ISE version (this is essential: no 
  mechanism should be definitively accepted until there is a working 
  implementation); only major difference is that I have changed `argument-' 
  feature names to `operand-' (have to check this with experts next week). I 
  haven't done anything on class TYPE yet.

  <A href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/elks.pdf">ELKS

  course be kept as obsolete.

<P><I>December 17, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.50-0.</B> Intermediate version -- 
conformance chapter is in progress, a few corrections elsewhere. The significant 
revision will come in the next few days. Working on several things (integer 
classes, conformance, anchored declarations). 
<P><I>December 12, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.47-1.</B> Same as 4.47-0 but 
everything put back together on Unix; links should work normally. 
<P><I>December 4, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.47-0.</B> New version of <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/agent.pdf">agent chapter</A> 
integrating the new inline agent mechanism, and new examples (once per object, 
controlled execution). Also, class TYPE now has a generic parameter (this seems 
surprising at first but I think it's right -- see the text). <B>Important 
caveat</B>: the text has been prepared on Windows rather than Unix and will show 
a few glitches. In particular links to other chapters probably won't work. Page 
numbers are wrong (book has not been regenerated). This will only be fixed 
around Dec. 15. <A name=creationexp2></A>
<P><I>November 5, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.46-4.</B> Changed creation expression 
syntax again in <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/creation.pdf">creation 
chapter</A>. This is basically to undo the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/#creationexp1">previous change 
(September 2)</A> after some people convinced me it was a bad idea. So the 
previous syntax with the <FONT color=#0000a0><B>create</B></FONT> keyword is 
back. I may have forgotten to update some of the examples; if you notice any 
please <A href="mailto:Bertrand_Meyer@eiffel.com">tell me</A>. Also did some 
minor cleanup on the rest of the chapter. 
<P><I>November 3, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.46-3.</B> Cleaned up <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/structure.pdf">system 
architecture chapter</A>. The new "root procedure rule" (CSRP, page 165) was 
included some time ago together with the revised Root Class rule (CSRC, page 
164), but I added the clause (obvious, but missed until now) that the root 
procedure must be a creation procedure of the root class. Updated <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/changes.pdf">changes 
appendix</A> accordingly. Otherwise, no major change. 
<P><I>November 3, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.46-2.</B> Cleaned up <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/class.pdf">classes chapter</A>. 
Nothing earth-shattering. Next is architecture chapter, so that the beginning of 
the book (except tutorials) will be all in a clean state. 
<P><I>November 1, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.46-1.</B> Revised <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/generic.pdf">genericity 
chapter</A> in line of conventions adopted for <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type chapter</A> (see 
4.46-1). Made small adaptations to type chapter to mention that for 
Formal_generic_name expanded/reference status is known only for a specific 
generic derivation. 
<P><I>October 31, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.46-0.</B> Finished <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type chapter</A>. 
Relaxed VTAT rule on anchored types so that it is permitted to use an anchored 
entity as anchor; this requires a rule on the absence of cycles. (See Michael 
Schweitzer's note on the topic in the <A target=new 
href="http://eiffel.com/nice/language/vip">VIP discussions</A>; note that I have 
not found necessary to follow his suggestion for a similar no-cycle rule on 
generic constraints.) A small point of semantics has been left unaddressed 
(reference/expanded status is not known if base type is Formal_generic_name). I 
will take care of this at the same time I clean up the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">genericity chapter</A> 
to make sure that type semantics is uniformly in the same style: specify 
reference or expanded status; specify base type.

<P><I>October 23, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.45-1.</B> Worked on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type chapter</A>. 
Systematized the presentation, especially for semantics. Defined the semantics 
of the `reference TYPE_NAME' types (by symmetry with `expanded TYPE_NAME') as 
proposed by Franck Arnaud. Stopped after page 390; anything after that is in an 
unsuitable state. For the "finished" part up to page 390, the usual caveats 
apply. In terms of work of substance rather than form, the serious piece of work 
that remains to be done on this chapter is to allow anchoring a type, as in 
`like t', on an expanded `t'. 
<P><I>October 22, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.45-0.</B> Simplified syntax for 
multi-line strings, now called "verbatim strings": "[ and ]" rather than "[% and 
%]". Updated corresponding section in <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/expression.pdf">expression 
chapter</A> (but rest of chapter still unfit for human consumption). Updated 
examples in <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">externals 
chapter</A> accordingly. Started work on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/type.pdf">type chapter</A>. (I 
know, this is not the one I was supposed to handle now, but it shouldn't take 
long and it felt natural.) Usual caveats apply.

<P><I>October 17, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.44-5.</B> Improved syntax of assignment 
procedures in <A

chapter</A>, following a suggestion of Roger Browne. Finished <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/conventions.pdf">Syntax, 
validity and semantics</A> chapter. Usual caveats apply. 
<P><I>October 10, 1999</I>: <B>Version 4.44-4.</B> Implemented new version 
numbering system. Updated DLL syntax to allow for names as well as indexes. 
Touched a few other chapters (structure, basic conventions, regarding letter 
case). 
<P><I>October 9, 1999</I> For the first time, brought the appendix on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/reserved.pdf">reserved words and 
special symbols</A> to a clean state, although I don't claim completeness and 
haven't introduced the cross-references yet. 
<P><I>October 9, 1999</I> Made a change in the C interface sublanguage following 
another of Pierre Métras's suggestions: using a $ sign (rather than quotes) to 
denote Eiffel entities in C inline text. 
<P><I>October 8, 1999</I> Some important changes (important not for practical 
programming but for theoretical consistency) to the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/elks.pdf">ELKS appendix</A>: 
GENERAL now deferred; ceases to be a useful practical type, replaced in this 
role by ANY; `as_any' introduced in GENERAL to avoid typing problems. This 
follows discussions with Marcel Satchell; see the Talkitover group. 
<P><I>October 8, 1999</I> Finalized (for the moment) the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">externals</A> 
chapter by updating the Cecil part (which is now consistent with the current 
Cecil, see the <A 
href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/library/cecil/page.html">online 
manual</A>) and integrating some of the suggestions from Pierre Métras on the 
Talkitover group. 
<P><I>October 5, 1999</I> Fixed a mistake in the syntax for <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/creation.pdf">creation</A> 
expressions (the <B><FONT="#0000A0">create</FONT></B> keyword, absent from 
informal explanations, was still present in the formal syntax). Note comment on 
Talkitover group about possible "gotcha". 
<P>Cleaned up the <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">externals</A> 
chapter by fixing all cross-references ... and then messed it up again by adding 
at the end the text of the online CECIL documentation from the ISE Web pages. I 
had to do that because the CECIL text in the book, straight out of the first 
edition, was woefully out of date. The text I added is just the plain 
de-htmlized form of the online manual; in the next few days I will clean it up 
and merge it with the rest of the chapter. So much for previously announced 
plans to which, however, I will return as soon as this tedious but necessary 
task has been completed. 
<P><I>October 3, 1999</I> Minor fixes to <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">external 
interfaces</A> chapter following comments by Marcel Satchell. Moved PDF files 
back from Monash to eiffel.com. 
<P><I>September 26, 1999</I> Revised chapter on <A 
href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/etl/others.pdf">Interfaces to other 
languages</A>. Note that <B>the cross-references are wrong</B> (and incomplete) 
since I had to finish the writing under Windows and I manage cross-references 
under Unix. They should be fixed within a week. The files are still physically

it was a trivial matter to convert this article back into a revised version of

<P><I>September 2, 1999</I> Changed section on creation expressions in <A

be written just {TYPE} or {TYPE .make (...), without `create' keyword (which

There are still some uses of !! in later chapters. 
<P><I>July 18, 1999</I>: Redid most of the book's figures. I only ignored a few 
that can easily be copy-and-pasted from others. I focused on the cosmetics of 
the figure, not on their semantics, so many are probably wrong. 
<P><I>July 17, 1999</I>: I have started working on the figures. The class 
bubbles are still too big. So far, covered only the first few chapters. (Stopped 
in the middle of "Feature adaptation", page 300).
