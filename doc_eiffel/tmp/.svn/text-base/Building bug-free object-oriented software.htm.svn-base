<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>OVERVIEW</H3>The notion of Design by Contract is central in the systematic 
  approach to object-oriented software construction, as embodied in the Eiffel 
  method. This article presents the key ideas. 
  <P>I should perhaps preface the description by stating that in my opinion the 
  techniques outlined below are <B><I>as important as anything else in object 
  technology</B></I>: as important as classes, objects, inheritance, 
  polymorphism and dynamic binding (which they complement). This may appear 
  surprising at first, since only a subset of the O-O literature - including the 
  references at the end of this paper - has described then in depth; but in my 
  experience the use of Design by Contract provides the software developer with 
  an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous techniques. 
  <P>The reader is urged to go beyond the theoretical understanding provided by 
  this paper and try the power of the ideas by using the <A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/eiffel">Eiffel environment</A>, which is their 
  direct implementation. 
  <H3>1 - INTRODUCTION </H3>
  <P>When thinking of new software development methods and tools, many people 
  tend to view <I>productivity</I> as the major expected benefit. For 
  object-oriented technology, this is, I believe, inappropriate. Who really 
  cares about the number of lines programmers churn out each month? What matters 
  is how good these lines are. In other words the focus should be less on 
  productivity than on <I>quality</I>. Better software methods, languages and 
  tools should also better productivity, of course, but mainly as a by-product 
  of improved quality. 
  <P>In the words of K. Fujino, Vice President of NEC Corporation's C&amp;C 
  Software Development Group: 
  <P>
  <DL>
    <DD><I>When quality is pursued, productivity follows</I> <BR><BR>(Quoted in 
    Carlo Ghezzi, Dino Mandrioli and Mehdi Jazayeri, <I>Software 
    Engineering</I>, Prentice Hall 1991.) </DD></DL>
  <P>A major component of quality in software is reliability: a system's ability 
  to perform its job according to the specification </I>(<I>correctness</I>) and 
  to handle abnormal situations </I>(<I>robustness</I>). Put more simply, 
  reliability is the absence of bugs. 
  <P>Reliability, although desirable in software construction regardless of the 
  approach, is particularly important in the object-oriented method because of 
  the special role given by the method to reusability</I>: unless we can obtain 
  reusable software components whose correctness we can trust much more than we 
  trust the correctness of usual run-of-the-mill software, reusability is a 
  losing proposition. 
  <P>How can we build reliable object-oriented software? The answer has several 
  components. Static typing, for example, is a major help for catching 
  inconsistencies before they have had time to become bugs. Such a technique as 
  garbage collection, although sometimes dismissed as an implementation detail, 
  is actually essential too, removing the specter of devious memory management 
  errors. By itself, reusability also helps: if you are able to reuse component 
  libraries produced and </I>(presumably</I>) validated by a reputable outside 
  source, rather than developing your own solution for every single problem you 
  encounter, you can start trusting part of the software no less than you trust 
  the machine on which it runs. In effect, the reusable libraries become part of 
  the "hardware-software machine" </I>(hardware, operating system, 
  compiler</I>). 
  <P>But this is not enough. To be sure that our object-oriented software will 
  perform properly, we need a systematic approach to specifying and implementing 
  object-oriented software elements and their relations in a software system. 
  This article introduces such a method, known as Design by Contract. Under the 
  Design by Contract theory, a software system is viewed as a set of 
  communicating components whose interaction is based on precisely defined 
  specifications of the mutual obligations -- contracts. 
  <P>The benefits of Design by Contract include the following: 
  <UL>
    <LI>A better understanding of the object-oriented method and, more 
    generally, of software construction. 
    <LI>A systematic approach to building bug-free object-oriented systems. 
    <LI>An effective framework for debugging, testing and, more generally, 
    quality assurance. 
    <LI>A method for documenting software components. 
    <LI>Better understanding and control of the inheritance mechanism. 
    <LI>A technique for dealing with abnormal cases, leading to a safe and 
    effective language construct for exception handling. </LI></UL>
  <P>The ideas developed below are part of <A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/eiffel">Eiffel</A> [<A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/documentation.html#oosc">1</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/documentation.html#etl">3</A>] which the reader is 
  urged to view here not so much as a programming language but rather as a 
  software development method. A longer exposition of the approach may be found 
  in a recent article [2]. 
  <H3>2 - SPECIFICATION AND DEBUGGING </H3>
  <P>As a key step towards improving software reliability, it is important to 
  realize that the first and perhaps most difficult problem is to define as 
  precisely as possible, for each software element, what it is supposed to do. 
  The immediate objection is that specifying a module's purpose will not ensure 
  that it will achieve that specification</I>; this is obviously true, but: 
  <UL>
    <LI>One may reverse this proposition and note that if we don't state what a 
    module should do, there is little likelihood that it will do it. (The law of 
    excluded miracles.) 
    <LI>In practice, it is amazing to see how far just stating what a module 
    should do goes towards helping to ensure that it does it. </LI></UL>As will be 
  seen below, the presence of a specification, even if it does not fully 
  guarantee the module's correctness, is a good basis for systematic testing and 
  debugging. 
  <P>The Design by Contract theory, then, suggests associating a specification 
  with every software element. These specifications </I>(or contracts</I>) 
  govern the interaction of the element with the rest of the world. 
  <P>This presentation will not, however, advocate the use of full formal 
  specifications. Although the work on formal specifications in general is 
  attractive, we settle for an approach in which specifications are not 
  necessarily exhaustive. This has the advantage that the specification language 
  is embedded in the design and programming language </I>(here Eiffel</I>), 
  whereas formal specification languages are typically non-executable or, if 
  they are executable, can only be used for prototypes. Here our criteria are 
  more demanding: we want our language to be used for practical commercial 
  development and hence to yield efficient implementation. This preserves a key 
  property of a well-understood object-oriented process</I>: its 
  <B>seamlessness</I>, which makes it possible to use a single notation and a 
  single set of concepts throughout the software lifecycle, from analysis to 
  implementation and maintenance, ensuring better mapping from solution to 
  problem and hence, among other benefits, smoother evolution. 
  <H3>3 - THE NOTION OF CONTRACT </H3>
  <P>In human affairs, contracts are written between two parties when one of 
  them </I>(the <I>supplier</I>) performs some task for the other </I>(the 
  <I>client</I>). Each party expects some benefits from the contract, and 
  accepts some obligations in return. Usually, what one of the parties sees as 
  an obligation is a benefit for the other. The aim of the contract document is 
  to spell out these benefits and obligations. 
  <P>A tabular form such as the following </I>(illustrating a contract between 
  an airline and a customer</I>) is often convenient for expressing the terms of 
  such a contract: 
  <TABLE border=1>
    <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TH></TH>
      <TH>Obligations</TH>
      <TH>Benefits</TH></TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>Client</TD>
      <TD>Be at the Santa Barbara airport at least 5 minutes before scheduled 
        departure time. Bring only acceptable baggage. Pay ticket price. </TD>
      <TD>Reach Chicago. </TD></TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>Supplier </TD>
      <TD>Bring customer to Chicago. </TD>
      <TD>No need to carry passenger who is late, has unacceptable baggage, or 
        has not paid ticket price. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
  <P>A contract document protects both the client, by specifying how much should 
  be done, and the supplier, by stating that the supplier is not liable for 
  failing to carry out tasks outside of the specified scope. 
  <P>The same ideas apply to software. Consider a software element <I>E</I>. To 
  achieve its purpose </I>(fulfil its own contract</I>), <I>E</I> uses a certain 
  strategy, which involves a number of subtasks, <I>t<FONT size=-2>1</FONT>, ... 
  t<FONT size=-2>n</FONT></I>. If subtask <I>t<FONT size=-2>i</FONT></I> is 
  non-trivial, it will be achieved by calling a certain routine <I>R</I>. In 
  other words, <I>E</I> contracts out the subtask to <I>R</I>. Such a situation 
  should be governed by a well-defined roster of obligations and benefits -- a 
  contract. 
  <P>Assume for example that <I>t<FONT size=-2>i</FONT></I> is the task of 
  inserting a certain element into a dictionary </I>(a table where each element 
  is identified by a certain character string used as key</I>) of bounded 
  capacity. The contract will be: 
  <TABLE border=1>
    <TBODY>
    <TR>
      <TH></TH>
      <TH>Obligations</TH>
      <TH>Benefits</TH></TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>Client</TD>
      <TD>Make sure table is not full and key is a non-empty string. </TD>
      <TD>Get updated table where the given element now appears, associated 
        with the given key. </TD></TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>Supplier </TD>
      <TD>Record given element in table, associated with given key. </TD>
      <TD>No need to do anything if table is full, or key is empty string. 
    </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
  <P>This contract governs the relations between the routine and any potential 
  caller. It contains the most important information that can be given about the 
  routine</I>: what each party in the contract must guarantee for a correct 
  call, and what each party is entitled to in return. 
  <P>So important indeed is this information that we cannot remain satisfied 
  with an informal specification of the contract as above. In the spirit of 
  seamlessness </I>(encouraging us to include every relevant information, at all 
  levels, in a single software text</I>), we should equip the routine text with 
  a listing of the appropriate conditions. Assuming the routine is called 
  <I>put</I>, it will look as follows in Eiffel syntax, as part of a generic 
  class <I>DICTIONARY </I>[<I>ELEMENT</I>]: <PRE><I>
put </I>(<I>x</I>:<I> ELEMENT</I>;<I> key</I>:<I> STRING</I>)<I> <B>is</B>
</I>-- Insert <I>x</I> so that it will be retrievable through <I>key</I>.
<I><B>require</B>
count &lt;= capacity</I>;<I>
<B>not</B> key.empty
<B>do</B>
</I>... Some insertion algorithm ...<I>
<B>ensure</B>
has </I>(<I>x</I>);<I>
item </I>(<I>key</I>)<I> = x</I>;<I>
count = <B>old</B> count + 1
<B>end</B></I>
</PRE>
  <P>The <B><I>require</I></B> clause introduces an input condition, or 
  precondition; the <B><I>ensure</I></B> clause introduces an output condition, 
  or postcondition. Both of these conditions are examples of assertions, or 
  logical conditions (contract clauses) associated with software elements. In 
  the precondition, <I>count</I> is the current number of elements and 
  <I>capacity</I> is the maximum number; in the postcondition, <I>has</I> is the 
  boolean query which tells whether a certain element is present, and 
  <I>item</I> returns the element associated with a certain key. The notation 
  <I><B>old</B> count</I> refers to the value of <I>count</I> on entry to the 
  routine. 
  <H3>4 - CONTRACTS IN ANALYSIS </H3>
  <P>The above example is extracted from a routine describing an implementation 
  (although the notion of dictionary is in fact meaningful independently of any 
  implementation concern). But the concepts are just as interesting at the 
  analysis level. Imagine for example a model of a chemical plant, with classes 
  such as <I>TANK</I>, <I>PIPE</I>, <I>VALVE</I>, <I>CONTROL_ROOM</I>. Each one 
  of these classes describes a certain data abstraction -- a certain type of 
  real-world objects, characterized by the applicable features (operations). For 
  example, <I>TANK</I> may have the following features: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Yes/no queries: <I>is_empty, is_full...</I> 
    <LI>Other queries: <I>in_valve, out_valve</I> (both of type <I>VALVE</I>), 
    <I>gauge_reading</I>, <I>capacity</I>... 
    <LI>Commands: <I>fill, empty, ...</I></I> </LI></UL>
  <P>Then to characterize a command such as <I>fill</I> we may use a 
  precondition and postcondition as above: <PRE><I>fill <B>is</B>
</I>-- Fill tank with liquid<I>
<B>require</B>
in_valve.open</I>;<I>
out_valve.closed
<B>deferred</B>	</I>-- i.e., no implementation<I>
<B>ensure</B>
in_valve.closed</I>;<I>
out_valve.closed</I>;<I>
is_full
<B>end</B></I>
</PRE>
  <P>This style of analysis avoids a classic dilemma of analysis and 
  specification: either you use a programming notation and run the risk of 
  making premature implementation commitments; or you stick with a higher-level 
  notation ("bubbles and arrows") and you must remain vague, forsaking one of 
  the major benefit of the analysis process, the ability to state and clarify 
  delicate properties of the system. Here the notation is precise (thanks to the 
  assertion mechanism, which may be used to capture the semantics of various 
  operations) but avoids any implementation commitment. (There is no danger of 
  such a commitment in the above example, since what it describes includes no 
  software and indeed no computer yet! Here we are using the notation just as a 
  modeling tool.) 
  <P>The <A href="http://www.eiffel.com/products/bon">Business Object 
  Notation</A>, as described by Waldén and Nerson [<A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/documentation.html#soosa">5</A>], is as far as I 
  know the only O-O method that fully integrates these ideas at the analysis and 
  design level, providing graphical notation for the ideas developed in the 
  present article. 
  <H3>5 - INVARIANTS </H3>
  <P>Preconditions and postconditions apply to individual routines. It is also 
  important to use assertions to characterize a class as a whole, rather than 
  its individual routines. An assertion describing a property which holds of all 
  instances of a class is called a <B>class invariant</I>. For example, the 
  invariant of <I>DICTIONARY</I> could state <PRE><I><B>invariant</B>
0 &lt;= count; count &lt;="capacity" </PRE>
  <P>and the invariant of <I>TANK</I> could state that <I>is_full</I> really 
  means "is approximately full": <PRE><I><B>invariant</B>
is_full = </I>(<I>0.97 * capacity &lt;= gauge</I>)<I> <B>and </I></I>(<I>gauge
&lt;= 1.03 * capacity</I>) ... </PRE>
  <P>Class invariants are consistency constraints characterizing the semantics 
  of a class. This notion is important as a basis for configuration management 
  and regression testing, since it describes the deeper properties of a class: 
  not just the characteristics it has at at a certain moment of its evolution, 
  but the constraints which must also apply to subsequent changes. In my view, 
  the notion of class invariant is one of the three or four most important 
  concepts in the whole object-oriented approach. 
  <P>Viewed from the contract theory, an invariant is a general clause which 
  applies to the entire set of contracts defining a class. 
  <H3>6 - DOCUMENTATION </H3>
  <P>Another key application of contracts is to provide a standard way to 
  document software elements -- classes. To provide client programmers with a 
  proper description of the interface properties of a class, it suffices to give 
  them a version of the class, known as the <B>short form</I>, which is stripped 
  of all implementation information but retains the essential usage information: 
  the contract. 
  <P>In the <A href="http://www.eiffel.com/products/bench.html">EiffelBench 
  environment</A>, you obtain the short form interactively by clicking on the 
  Short button of the Class Tool. The output can be plain text or can be 
  converted to any text processing format (Microsoft's RTF, HTML for Web 
  publishing, MIF or MML for FrameMaker, TEX, troff, Postscript etc.) through 
  one of the environment's predefined filters -- to which you can add any of 
  your own filters since the mechanism is completely open. (An online 
  introduction to the environment, showing the Class Tool, the short form and 
  other basic facilities, is <A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/bench/tour/index.html">available for 
  Web browsing</A>.) 
  <P>The short form retains headers and assertions of exported features, as well 
  as invariants, but discards everything else. For example: <PRE><I><B>class interface </B>DICTIONARY </I>[<I>ELEMENT</I>]<I> <B>feature</B>
<BR><BR>
put </I>(<I>x</I>:<I> ELEMENT</I>;<I> key</I>:<I> STRING</I>)<I> <B>is</B>
</I>-- Insert <I>x</I> so that it will be retrievable through <I>key</I>.<I>
<B>require</B>
count &lt;= capacity</I>;<I>
<B>not</B> key.empty
<B>ensure</B>
has </I>(<I>x</I>);<I>
item </I>(<I>key</I>)<I> = x</I>;<I>
count = <B>old</B> count + 1
<BR><BR>
</I>... Interface specifications of other features ...<I> <BR><BR>
<B>invariant</B>
<BR><BR>
0 &lt;= count; count &lt;="capacity" <BR><BR>
<B>end class interface </B> </I>-- <I>DICTIONARY</I></I> </PRE>
  <P>This short form serves as the basic tool for documenting libraries and 
  other software elements. It also serves as a central communication tool 
  between developers. We have learned from our customers and from our own 
  experience that emphasis on the short form facilitates software design and 
  project management, as it encourages developers and managers to discuss the 
  key issues (interface, specification, inter-module protocols) rather than 
  internal details. 
  <H3>7 - TESTING, DEBUGGING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE </H3>
  <P>Given a class text equipped with assertions, we should ideally be able to 
  prove mathematically that the routine implementations are consistent with the 
  assertions. In the absence of realistic tools to do this, we can settle for 
  the next best thing, which is to use assertions for testing. 
  <P>Compilation options enable the developers, class by class, what effect 
  assertions should have if any: </I>no assertion checking (under which 
  assertions have no effect at all, serving as a form of standardized comments), 
  preconditions only </I>(the default</I>), preconditions and postconditions, 
  all of the above plus class invariants, all assertions. 
  <P>These mechanisms provide a powerful tool for finding mistakes. Assertion 
  monitoring is a way to check what the software does against what its author 
  thinks it does. This yields a productive approach to debugging, testing and 
  quality assurance, in which the search for errors is not blind but based on 
  consistency conditions provided by the developers themselves. 
  <P>The availability of these mechanisms is in my experience one of the most 
  significant consequences of moving to this technology. It causes a dramatic 
  drop in the number of bugs, and a new attitude of developers towards software 
  reliability. 
  <H3>8 - CONTRACTS AND INHERITANCE </H3>
  <P>An important consequence of the contract theory is to yield a better 
  understanding of the central object-oriented notions of inheritance, 
  polymorphism, redefinition and dynamic binding. 
  <P>A class <I>B</I> which inherits from a class <I>A</I> may provide a new 
  declaration for a certain inherited feature <I>r</I> of <I>A</I>. For example 
  a specialized implementation of <I>DICTIONARY</I> might redefine the algorithm 
  for <I>put</I>. Such redefinitions are potentially dangerous, however, as the 
  redefined version could in principle have a completely different semantics. 
  This is particularly worrisome in the presence of polymorphism, which means 
  that in the call <PRE><I>a.r</I>
</PRE>
  <P>the target <I>a</I> of the call, although declared statically of type 
  <I>A</I>, could in fact be attached at run time to an object of type <I>B</I>. 
  Then <B>dynamic binding</I> implies that the <I>B</I> version of <I>r</I> will 
  be called in such a case. 
  <P>This is a form of subcontracting: <I>A</I> subcontracts <I>r</I> to 
  <I>B</I> for targets of the corresponding type. But a subcontractor must be 
  bound by the original contract. A client which executes a call under the form <PRE><I><B>if</B> a.pre <B>then</B>
a.r
<B>end</B></I>
</PRE>
  <P>must be guaranteed the contractually promised result: the call will be 
  correctly executed since the precondition is satisfied (assuming that 
  <I>pre</I> implies the precondition of <I>r</I>); and on exit <I>a.post</I> 
  will be true, where <I>post</I> is the postcondition of <I>r</I>. 
  <P>The fundamental <B>principle of subcontracting</I> follows from these 
  observations: a redefined version of <I>r</I> may keep or weaken the 
  precondition; it may keep or strengthen the postcondition. Strengthening the 
  precondition, or weakening the postcondition, would be a case of "dishonest 
  subcontracting" and could lead to disaster. The Eiffel language rules for 
  assertion redefinition [<A 
  href="http://www.eiffel.com/documentation.html#etl">3</A>] support the 
  principle of subcontracting. 
  <P>These observations shed light on the true significance of inheritance: not 
  just a reuse, subtyping and classification mechanism, but a way to ensure 
  compatible semantics by other means. They also provide useful guidance as to 
  how to use inheritance properly. 
  <H3>9 - EXCEPTION HANDLING </H3>
  <P>Among the many other applications of the contract theory we may note that 
  the theory leads naturally to a systematic approach to the thorny problem of 
  exception handling -- handling abnormal cases. 
  <P>A software element is always a way to fulfil a certain contract, explicit 
  or not. An exception is the element's inability to fulfil its contract, for 
  any reason: a hardware failure has occurred, a called routine has failed, a 
  software bug makes it impossible to satisfy the contract. 
  <P>In such cases only three responses make sense: 
  <OL>
    <LI><B>Retrying</I>: an alternative strategy is available. The routine will 
    restore the invariant and and make another attempt, using the new strategy. 
    <LI><B>Organized panic</I>: no such alternative is available. Restore the 
    invariant, terminate, and report failure to the caller by triggering a new 
    exception. (The caller will itself have to choose between the same three 
    responses.) 
    <LI><B>False alarm</I>: it is in fact possible to continue, perhaps after 
    taking some corrective measures. This case seldom occurs (regrettably, since 
    it is the easiest to implement!). </LI></OL>
  <P>The exception mechanism follows directly from this analysis. It is based on 
  the notion of "rescue clause" associated with a routine, and of "retry 
  instruction", which implements retrying. This is similar to clauses that occur 
  in human contracts, to allow for exceptional, unplanned circumstances. If 
  there is a Rescue clause, any exception occurring during the routine's 
  execution will interrupt the execution of the body </I>(the <B>do</I> 
  clause</I>) and start execution of the Rescue</I> clause. The clause contains 
  one or more instructions</I>; one of them is a <B>retry</I>, which will cause 
  re-execution of the routine's body (the <B>do</I> clause). An integer local 
  entity such as <I>failure</I> is always initialized to zero on routine entry 
  (but not, of course, after a <B>retry</I>). 
  <P>Here is an example illustrating the mechanism (see [2, 3] for details). We 
  assume a low-level procedure <I>unsafe_transmit</I> for transmitting a message 
  over a network. We have no control over that procedure but know that it may 
  fail, in which case we want to try again, although after 100 unsuccessful 
  attempts we will give up, passing on the exception to our caller. The 
  Rescue/Retry mechanism supports this simply and directly: <PRE><I>attempt_transmission </I>(<I>message: STRING</I>)<I> <B>is</B>
</I>-- Attempt to transmit <I>message</I> over a communication line
-- using the low-level (C) procedure <I>unsafe_transmit</I>,
-- which may fail, triggering an exception.
-- After 100 unsuccessful attempts, give up (triggering
-- an exception in the caller).<I>
<BR><BR>
<B>local</B>
failures</I>:<I> INTEGER
<B>do</B>
unsafe_transmit </I>(<I>message</I>)<I>
<BR><BR>
<B>rescue</B>
failures </I>:=<I> failures + 1</I>;<I>
<BR><BR>
<B>if</B> failures &lt;100 <B>then</B>
<B>retry</B>
<B>end</B>
<B>end</B></I>
</PRE>
  <H3>10 - FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND CONCLUSION </H3>
  <P>This article has provided an overview of the basic ideas of Design by 
  Contract. This is a very active area of application and further research, with 
  several books in preparation. Two particularly important areas of development 
  are: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Concurrency and distribution</B>: the principles of Design by 
    Contract yield what I think is <I>the</I> solution to the problem of 
    concurrent and distribution object-oriented programming (avoiding the 
    so-called "inheritance anomaly" and other non-issues of O-O concurrent 
    computation, resulting from a misunderstanding of object technology). An 
    article [4] describes in detail the Eiffel approach to concurrent 
    computation, based on the Design by Contract concepts and currently in the 
    process of being implemented. I will devote one of my future columns to a 
    description of how these principles yield a simple, elegant approach to 
    object-oriented programming for the Internet.

  <P>Design by Contract has already been widely applied; the theory provides a 
  powerful thread throughout the object-oriented method, and addresses at least 
  in part many of the issues that many people are encountering as they start 
  applying object-oriented techniques and languages seriously: what kind of 
  "methodology" to apply, on what concepts to base the analysis step, how to 
  specify components, how to document object-oriented software, how to guide the 
  testing process and, most importantly, how to build software so that bugs do 
  not show up in the first place. 
  <P>In modern software development, reliability should be a built-in component 
  -- not an afterthought.
