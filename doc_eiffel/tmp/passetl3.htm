<P><SPAN class=title>Work in progress: ETL</SPAN> <BR><SPAN 
class=received>Received Thursday, 30 September 1999 at 19:54</SPAN> <PRE>For some time now I have been regularly updating a version of the third
edition of "Eiffel: The Language" on the Web. The URL is
 
    <A target=new href="http://eiffel.com/private/meyer/etlnew">http://eiffel.com/private/meyer/etlnew</A>
 
The page is password-protected:
 
    User name: Talkitover
    Password: etl3
 
There is also an associated Talkitover group at <A target=new href="http://talkitover.com/etl">http://talkitover.com/etl</A>
(same user name and password).
 
The reason for the password is to avoid this getting too public and causing
copyright problems. Eiffel users are, however, welcome to access the pages
and comment on the language using the associated Talkitover group
(but not, please, the present one -- many readers may be uninterested
in fine language discussions).
 
The language proposals represent my own views and do not commit ISE.
Clearly I intend to submit the resulting language, after numerous revisions
and comments, as the standard. The text as it stands is extremely partial
(as you will see I have lots and lots of work to do -- there has already gone
much effort even though that doesn't show). I am also not sure about a
number of things, e.g. assignment procedures.
 
A small group has been discussing some of the material already, but
this may be the time for a broader discussion. Again it has no official status,
it's just my work and commits no one else. I expect a lot of criticism.
 
Thanks in advance,
