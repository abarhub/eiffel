  <LI><B><A name=about_2>What is the Eclipse Project?</A></B> 
  <P>The <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/index.html">Eclipse Project</A> 
  is an open source software development project dedicated to providing a 
  robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, industry platform for the 
  development of highly integrated tools. It is composed of three subprojects, 
  <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/platform/index.html">Platform</A>, <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/index.html">JDT - Java development tools</A>, 
  and <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/pde/index.html">PDE - Plug-in development 
  environment.</A> The success of the Eclipse Platform depends on how well it 
  enables a wide range of tool builders to build best of breed integrated tools. 
  But the real vision of eclipse as an industry platform is only realized if 
  these tools from different tool builders can be combined together by users to 
  suit their unique requirements, in ways that the tool builders never even 
  imagined. The mission of the Eclipse Project is to adapt and evolve the 
  Eclipse Platform and associated tools to meet the needs of the tool building 
  community and its users, so that the vision of eclipse as an industry platform 
  is realized.</P>

  <LI><B><A name=about_3>What is the Eclipse Platform?</A></B> 
  <P>The <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/platform/index.html">Eclipse 
  Platform</A> is an open extensible IDE for anything and yet nothing in 
  particular. The Eclipse Platform provides building blocks and a foundation for 
  constructing and running integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse 
  Platform allows tool builders to independently develop tools that integrate 
  with other people's tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and 
  another starts.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=about_4>What is the Eclipse SDK?</A></B> 
  <P>The Eclipse SDK (software developer kit) is the consolidation of the 
  components produced by the three Eclipse Project subprojects (Platform, JDT - 
  Java development tools, and PDE - Plug-in development environment) into a 
  single download.</P>
  <P>Together these pieces provide a feature-rich development environment that 
  allows the developer to efficiently create tools that integrate seamlessly 
  into the Eclipse Platform. </P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=about_5>How is the Eclipse SDK licensed?</A></B> 
  <P>The Eclipse SDK consists of software produced by the Eclipse Project 
  combined with third party software from other open source projects. The 
  software produced by the Eclipse Project is made available under the <A

  <LI><B><A name=about_1>What is eclipse.org?</A></B> 
  <P>Eclipse.org is a <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/index.html">consortium</A> of 
  software-development-tool vendors formed to foster the development . The 
  eclipse community was formed in order to create better development 
  environments and product integration. The community shares an interest in 
  creating products that are easily inter-operable, because they are based upon 
  plug-in technology and a common platform. By collaborating and sharing core 
  integration technology, vendors who build on the Eclipse Platform can 
  concentrate on their areas of expertise and the creation of new 
technology.</P>

  release will have fewer bugs but the most recent stable build will have all

  the latest release so you won't be confused by random bugs in the latest

  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=users_3>I have downloaded the Eclipse SDK, but it won't start. 
  How do I start eclipse?</A></B> 
  <P>The number one reason is that the JRE cannot be located to run eclipse. You 
  must have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer. Eclipse 
  requires version 1.3 or 1.4 of a Java 2 Standard Edition JRE. The Eclipse SDK 
  does <B>not</B> ship with a JRE.</P>
  <P>We recommend that you download and install a Java developer kit. The 
  developer kit will include a Java runtime that you can use to launch eclipse. 
  Each build page contains a link to a page of suggested developer kit and Java 
  runtime downloads that should work with the eclipse build. You can also find 
  these links to commercial vendors that supply Java developer kits and Java 
  runtime environments in the table below. You will need to decide for yourself 
  which works best for you, and which licensing terms work best for you.</P>

  <P>Once you have installed a Java developer kit, you can use the -vm command 
  line argument to launch eclipse. For example, if you have installed a Java 
  developer kit in c:\jdk1.3, you can launch eclipse with the following command 
  line:</P>
  <P><CODE>eclipse.exe -vm c:\jdk1.3\bin\javaw.exe</CODE> 
  <P>
  <P>NOTE: Some Java runtimes and developer kits install themselves on the

  when you launch eclipse. If you want to use a different Java runtime or want 
  to be sure of which Java runtime you are running, simply use the -vm argument 
  and eclipse will use the Java runtime you specify.</P>

  <P>The Eclipse Project uses <A href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</A> as 
  its bug tracking system. Entering a bug report is as simple as filling in a 
  web form on the <A href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">eclipse bugzilla 
  page</A>. The first time you enter a bug you will need to <A 
  href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/createaccount.cgi">create a new bugzilla 
  account</A> for yourself by providing an email address and choosing a 
  password.</P>
  <P>But <B>wait!</B> Before you enter a bug report, <A 
  href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi">search bugzilla</A> to see if 
  someone else has already entered a bug report similar to yours. If you find a 
  bug report that outlines the problem you are seeing, you can simply annotate 
  it with your comments to let the developers know that you have also hit the 
  bug.</P>
  <P>Once you have searched bugzilla and not found anything, you can go ahead 
  and enter a new bug report. Please read the bug writing guidelines located on 
  the <A href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugzilla.html">eclipse bug reporting

  <LI><B><A name=users_12>How do I bring my Java files into eclipse?</A></B> 
  <P>The best way to do bring your pre-existing Java files into eclipse is to 
  create a Java project and copy your files into the project. You can copy the 
  files into the project using a number of methods. You can: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Use the import facility, File-&gt;Import... 
    <LI>Copy the files into the project folder in the OS. Then right click on 
    the project and select Refresh From Local. 
    <LI>(Win32 only) Drag the files from the desktop, a folder, or an Explorer 
    window into the project. </LI></UL>
  <P>If you do not want to copy the files, you can create a Java project that is 
  located at the folder that contains your Java source. For example, let's say 
  you have 5000 source files in directory tree under c:\work. You can create a 
  Java project and set its location to c:\work. To do this, uncheck the "Use 
  default location" check box in the new project wizard to specify the 
  location.</P>NOTE: Eclipse does <B>not</B> allow project locations to 
  overlap.<BR>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=users_12.5>When I delete a project eclipse asks if I want to 
  delete the content. What does this mean?</A></B> 
  <P>The Eclipse Platform stores your project contents in a directory. By 
  default this directory is in the workspace directory and is named with the 
  project name. When you delete a project, you are asked if you want to delete 
  the contents of this directory.</P>
  <P>In many cases it is desirable to delete the contents and the project 
  entirely. But when you have located your project in a location other than in 
  the default location, you may want to keep your files, and simply remove the 
  project from your Eclipse workspace.</P>
  <P>TIP: <B>Be careful!</B> If you have created a project in a location other 
  than the default location you can delete files that you did not intend to.</P>

  source by editing your Java project classpath: 
  <OL>

  <LI><B><A name=users_13.5>Why are my resources being copied to my project's 
  output folder?</A></B> 
  <P>When a project's build path is configured with an output folder, JDT 
  generates class files into this folder and copies resources inside the 
  packages to the output folder. This ensures that the resources will be found 
  at runtime by the running Java application. To avoid the resource copying, you 
  can do one of the following.</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Do not use source folders and set the output folder to the project 
    itself 
    <LI>Put your resources that should not be copied into a folder (for example, 
    doc) that you do not add as a source folder to the Java build path of your 
    project. </LI></UL>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_1>What build should I download?</A></B> 
  <P>If you are building tool plugins designed to run on a previously released 
  version of the Eclipse Platform, you should download the corresponding release 
  of the Eclipse SDK. However in most cases plug-in developers will want to use 
  the most recent stable build of the Eclipse SDK. These builds are used by the 
  eclipse developers, and will have the most recent bug fixes and features. By 
  using the latest stable build tool builders can stay on top of the latest 
  changes and improvements and provide feedback, bug reports, suggested fixes, 
  and contribute to the evolution of eclipse. You can find the latest builds on 
  the <A href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">downloads page</A>. A 
  notice will be posted to the newsgroup when a new stable build is available. 
  </P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_1.5>How does the Eclipse SDK build process work?</A></B> 

  <P>Nightly builds of the Eclipse SDK are performed by building the current 
  contents of the HEAD stream of the projects in the Eclipse Project CVS 
  repository.</P>
  <P>Integration builds are performed on Tuesdays at noon EST. They are built 
  using versions of projects located in the CVS repository. Each component team 
  submits which version should be included in the build. The goal of the 
  integration build is to create a stable build. Discussion about the problems 
  with, and patches for, integration builds can be found on the eclipse-dev 
  mailing list.</P>
  <P>The eclipse developers use each integration build to continue development. 
  If the developers feel comfortable using an integration build, it is promoted 
  to stable build status and it is posted to the builds page as a stable 
  build.</P>
  <P>Release builds represent the culmination of a release cycle. They are 
  rigorously tested stable builds that are designed for production use.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_2>How do I use the Eclipse SDK to write my 
  plug-in?</A></B> 
  <P>The <A 
  href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/pde-ui-home/selfhosting/selfhosting.html">self-hosting</A> 
  documentation outlines how you can use the Eclispe SDK to write your plug-in. 
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_3>Where is the Eclipse SDK documentation?</A></B> 
  <P>There are integrated documentation manuals in Help-&gt;Help Contents. You 
  can select a manual from the combo box. These documents are also available <A 
  href="http://eclipse.org/documentation/main.html">online</A>.</P>
  <P>The <A href="http://eclipse.org/whitepapers/eclipse-overview.pdf">Eclipse 
  Platform technical overview</A> describes the eclipse architecture and gives a 
  case study on using the architecture.</P>
  <P>There are many <A 
  href="http://eclipse.org/articles/index.html">articles</A> written by eclipse 
  developers and other contributers that drill down into specific technical 
  problems related to building tool plug-ins for eclipse. These articles are 
  generally very practical in nature and many come with example code.</P>
  <P>The javadoc is available as part of the integrated documentation the latest 
  version is also available <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/html/plugins/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/topics_Reference.html">online</A>. 
  To view the javadoc for the <I>particular</I> eclipse build you have 
  installed: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Help-&gt;Help Contents. 
    <LI>Select the Platform Plug-in Developers Guide from the combo box. 
    <LI>Select Reference-&gt;API Reference in the help manual tree. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P>Finally, check the component pages for the latest design documents and 
  other notes. The component pages can be found within each of the subprojects 
  of the <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/index.html">Eclipse Project 
  page</A>.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_4>Where can I find plug-in examples?</A></B> 
  <P>Example plug-ins are provided as a separate download with each build. If 
  you select a specific build from the <A 
  href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">downloads page</A>, you will 
  see a section labeled "Example Plug-ins".</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_5>I'm having trouble implementing my plug-in. Who should 
  I ask for help?</A></B> 
  <P>If you are encountering problems (related to the eclipse code base) while 
  implementing your plug-in, you can often get help from other members of the 
  eclipse community.</P>
  <P>Start by checking old posts to the newsgroup. You can either use your news 
  reader to search the messages or you can search the news archives (set the 
  search scope to "News Archives"). If you can't find an answer to your question 
  in old newsgroup posts, you can <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/search/search.cgi">search</A> the mailing lists 
  and the documentation.</P>
  <P>If you still can't find an answer to your question, post your question to 
  the newsgroup. But before participating in the newsgroup, you should read <A 
  href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"How to ask 
  questions the smart way"</A> by Eric Raymond.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_6>How do I find out what is currently being developed in 
  a component?</A></B> 
  <P>Check the component web page. It will detail the work that is currently 
  being done in the component and future plans the team has for the component. 
  Component web pages can be found under the Subproject web pages of the <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/index.html">Eclipse Project page</A>.</P>
  <P>You can also read the <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html">mailing list archives</A>. (If 
  you don't already have one you will need a news/mail archive <A 
  href="http://dev.eclipse.org/newsManager/newsRequestForm.html">password</A>).</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_6.5>Where can I find out what API has changed?</A></B> 
  <P>Check the javadoc. Changes to the API will be annotated with a @since 
  tag.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_7>I have a Swing application. Can I integrate it into 
  eclipse?</A></B> 
  <P>Yes you can - but there are some significant limitations, and the 
  integration is not as tight as when you build tools using SWT. The best way to 
  integrate tools into eclipse is to use SWT. To understand this, let's look at 
  the kinds of tool integration that are possible with the Eclipse 
  Platform:<BR><BR><B>In-Place-Java-Tools</B> coded using the Eclipse Platform 
  API's using JFace/SWT. This is the best integration approach and the mechanism 
  that most eclipse tools use. These tools run in the same VM and same class 
  libraries as the platform itself and can leverage the full integration API for 
  seamless integration. These tools open in-place in the eclpse workbench and 
  contribute views or editors into the workbench perspectives. Note that an 
  In-Place-Java-Tool is coded in Java, but the Java code can also make use of an 
  ActiveX control as part of its implementation (on the Windows platform 
  only).</P>
  <P><B>Launch-Java-Tools</B> coded in Java, using Swing or AWT.&nbsp; These 
  tools run in the same VM and same class libraries as the eclipse workbench 
  itself, but are otherwise loosely coupled and operate in much the same manner 
  as External-Launch-Tools. This mechanism allows swing-in-process tools to be 
  opened as separate windows (not in place).</P>
  <P><B>External-Launch-Tools</B> coded in any language, that are launched as 
  external programs. These tools open as separate windows and are&nbsp;not 
  visually integrated into the workbench. The platform provides automatic 
  launching of external editors based on file type associations provided by the 
  user or obtained from the underlying operating system.</P>
  <P><B>In-Place-OLE-Documents</B> (Windows platform only) allow standard OLE 
  enabled tools that support in-place OLE documents (such as MSWord, MS 
  Powerpoint, etc) to be invoked in place in the eclipse workbench to edit 
  documents of the corresponding type. These tools are otherwise loosely 
  integrated, and functionally they are the same as External-Launch tools i.e. 
  they open on a document, edit it, save it.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_7.25>What about swing-in-place?</A></B> <BR>You can have 
  a look at the SWT_AWT class which is an experimental mechanism that can be 
  used to integrate swing widgets into eclipse in-place. However, there are some 
  significant limitations associated with this: 
  <UL>
    <LI>It only works on Windows. &nbsp;Swing/AWT ships with a library that is 
    linked in such a way that it does not export its X/motif libraries and this 
    causes a problem where globals are concerned since SWT tries to use the same 
    libraries. 
    <LI>It does not work with light weight widgets. &nbsp;There are issues with 
    the keystrokes getting sent to the light weight widget. 
    <LI>It is experimental (in the internal package 
    org.eclipse.swt.internal.awt.win32) and therefore the API may change. 
    <P></P></LI></UL>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_7.5>What if I have existing swing code?</A></B> 
  <P>SWT was designed to be small, fast, and leverage the native widget system 
  available on each platform. In the area of high performance workstation tools, 
  we believe this is very important. If you want native look and feel and good 
  platform integration, then SWT is a good choice... and SWT is the best 
  approach for integrating tools into the eclipse platform. For the best results 
  Plug-in developers targeting tight eclipse integration should use SWT.&nbsp; 
  Plug-in developers with existing swing based components should in most cases 
  use the <B>Launch-Java-Tools</B> approach described above (yielding 
  swing-in-process) as a stepping stone towards ultimately achieving tighter 
  tool integration. The experimental internal mechanism for 
  <B>swing-in-place</B> should be used only after considering the risks and 
  limitations as indicated above.<BR>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_8>How do I use eclipse to develop eclipse?</A></B> 
  <P>The <A 
  href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/pde-ui-home/selfhosting/selfhosting.html">self-hosting</A> 
  instructions explain how to use eclipse to develop eclipse.</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>If you want to work with the current version of the eclipse code, you 
    will need to connect to the <A 
    href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/">Eclipse Project CVS repository</A>. 
    To connect to the Eclipse Project CVS repository, open the CVS repositories 
    view (Perspective-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...-&gt;CVS-&gt;CVS Repositories) 
    and create a new CVS repository location (right click-&gt;New-&gt;CVS 
    Repository Location. Enter the following information into the "Add CVS 
    Repository" dialog. 
    <UL>Connection type: pserver </UL>
    <UL>User name: anonymous </UL>
    <UL>Password: &lt;leave empty&gt; </UL>
    <UL>Host name: dev.eclipse.org </UL>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_9>How do I submit a fix for a bug?</A></B> 
  <P>While using the Eclipse SDK to develop your plug-in, you found a bug in 
  eclipse. You submitted a bug report, but need the fix now. You've debugged the 
  problem, and there is a simple fix. So you figured out how to use eclipse to 
  develop eclipse and have written a fix for the bug you found. Now you want to 
  release the fix to the eclipse community. How do you do this?</P>
  <P>First, create a patch. You can create a patch by using the Team patch 
  creation facility. 
  <OL>
    <LI>Select the project you have patched. It must be connected to the Eclipse 
    Project CVS repository. 
    <LI>Right click-&gt;Team-&gt;Create Patch... 
    <LI>The Create Patch wizard will prompt you for a file name. You should name 
    your patch with the bugzilla bug report id. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P>Now you can submit the patch to the appropriate component <A 
  href="http://www.eclipse.org/mail/index.html">developer mailing list</A>. Be 
  sure to include information about what your patch fixes. The committers for 
  the component will evaluate your patch to see if it fixes the bug and is 
  acceptable. If your patch is accepted, it will be released by the component 
  team into the repository.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=plugin_10>In addition to submitting fixes, how else can I 
  contribute to the Eclipse Project?</A></B> 
  <P>One initially thinks of submitting patches and enhancing components as the 
  best way to contribute. However, there are many other valuable ways to get 
  involved and help. 
  <UL>
    <LI>You can participate in the newsgroups. There are many questions that 
    arise on the newsgroup; you can use your eclipse experience to help others. 
    <LI>You can report bugs. 
    <LI>You can develop your own plug-ins and provide feedback based on your 
    experience. 
    <LI>You can write <A 
    href="http://www.eclipse.org/arg/index.html">articles</A>. 
    <LI>But the most important contribution you can make to the success of 
    eclipse is to build real, useful tool plugins for eclipse that solve real 
    problems for users - either as commercial products or open source projects.

  <LI><B><A name=misc_1>Where can I get more plug-ins?</A></B> 
  <P>The eclipse.org site includes a project called <A 
  href="http://eclipse.org/tools/index.html">The Eclipse Tools Project</A>. The 
  mission of the Eclipse Tools Project is to foster the creation of a wide 
  variety of tools for the Eclipse Platform. Although some experimental plug-ins 
  can be found on component pages, eclipse.org does not provide a generic area 
  for the community to share plug-ins. But there are already some plug-in 
  projects on <A 
  href="http://www.sourceforge.org/">http://www.sourceforge.org/</A>, and in the 
  future eclipse.org will provide a way to locate other tool plugins designed to 
  work with eclipse.</P>
  <HR SIZE=1>

  <LI><B><A name=misc_2></A>What other programming languages does the Eclipse 
  Platform support?</B> 
  <P>The Eclipse Platform is a universal tool platform. It has no knowledge of 
  any specific language, but opens the door for plug-ins to support various 
  languages. Similarly, the platform provides support for building source 
  editors for specific programming languages but it doesn't actually include 
  those editors.</P>
  <P>The Eclipse SDK includes a full featured Java IDE. This is an example of 
  how to extend the platform to support a particular language. The SDK provides 
  editors for Java files and for plug-in XML files.</P>
  <P>If you are interested in tools for other languages, you should watch (or 
  join) <A href="http://eclipse.org/tools/index.html">The Eclipse Tools 
  Project</A>, which already has work on a C/C++ Development Tool plugin (CDT) 
  underway.</P>
