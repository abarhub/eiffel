      <p>
        A successful project requires many people to play many roles.
        Some members write code or documentation, while others are
        valuable as testers, submitting patches and suggestions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team is comprised of <a href="#Members">Members</a>
        and <a href="#Contributors">Contributors</a>.  Members 
        have direct access to the source of a project and actively
        evolve the code-base.  Contributors improve the project
        through submission of patches and suggestions to the Members.
        The number of Contributors to the project is unbounded.
