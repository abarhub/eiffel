      <p>
      	This file is used as a placeholder until the final link check can occur.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      	At present, you MUST set maven.linkcheck.enable=true in your project properties
      	to have the linkchecker run. Once it has stabilised, it will be turned on by default
      	(except in offline mode).
